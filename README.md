==============================

![Balloon Bomber World](/screenshots/scrn_02.jpg "Balloon Bomber World")

This assignment was done as a part of the Ryerson Graphics Course (CPS511).
My assignmnet was a Hot-Air Balloon Bomber mini-game. The goal is to fly a weaponized hot-air balloon and hit all the targets by dropping a bomb on them. The world terrain is generated at the start and 10 targets are placed in the world. The targets rise up and down for a short time during which you need to attack, then stay hidden for a while. Shoot down all the targets to win!

The assignment was done in C++ and uses the OpenGL Library.
